- Has form fields of Name, Email, Message, and ability to upload a File.
- All fields except File Upload are required.
- Accepted file formats are .pdf, .xlsx and .csv. All other formats are declined.
- It makes sure email is valid.
- It doesn't allow the same user whom has used the form in the last 5 minutes to submit a message then displays a message telling them to wait before they can send a new message.
- Has unit tests to validate save message feature.
- Where necessary it displays a message to the user informing them about failures or a successful submission.

Process to set up application

- Find the sql databse structure file in the root dir named `geneo-database.sql` and upload it on your database environment.
- Find `app/Config/database.php` and provide your database configuration parameters on `line 67` that looks like the example below:
```php
class DATABASE_CONFIG {

	public $default = array(
		'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
		'persistent' => false,
		'host' => 'localhost',
		'login' => 'root',
		'password' => 'password',
		'database' => 'geneo',
		'prefix' => '',
		//'encoding' => 'utf8',
	);

	public $test = array(
		'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
		'persistent' => false,
		'host' => 'localhost',
		'login' => 'root',
		'password' => 'password',
		'database' => 'geneo_test',
		'prefix' => '',
		//'encoding' => 'utf8',
	);
}
```
- Go to your browser and fire up your application using the server link depending on your server configurations, example of mine is: `http://localhost/geneo-test/messages/add`
- Fill the form to submit a message.
- You can also run test cases by going to: `http://localhost/geneo-test/test.php`
